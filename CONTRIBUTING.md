   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## üîß Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch
Always work on a new branch for your changes:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

### 2. Make Your Changes
- Write clean, readable code
- Follow the existing code style and conventions
- Add comments where necessary
- Update documentation if needed

### 3. Test Your Changes
```bash
npm test          # Run tests
npm run build     # Ensure build works
npm start         # Test locally
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes
Use conventional commit messages:
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add new life assessment feature"
git commit -m "fix: resolve slider responsiveness issue"
git commit -m "docs: update README with new features"
```

### 5. Push and Create a Pull Request
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```
Then create a Pull Request on GitHub.

## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### JavaScript/React
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow ESLint rules
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add PropTypes for component props
- Keep components focused and single-purpose

### CSS
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Follow BEM methodology where appropriate
- Use CSS custom properties for theming
- Ensure responsive design principles

### File Naming
- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `LifeBalanceHeader.js`)
- Files: camelCase (e.g., `pageStyles.css`)
- Folders: lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `life-balance`)

## üß™ Testing

### Writing Tests
- Write tests for new features
- Ensure existing tests pass
- Use descriptive test names
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### Running Tests
```bash
npm test                 # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage   # Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:ci         # Run tests once (for CI)
```
